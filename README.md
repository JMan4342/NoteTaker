  ## Description
  This application will allow you to write notes and save them.  After entering your note you can save it for future reference by clicking on the floppy disk icon in the upper right corner.  By utilizing the Express for NodeJS, the notes will be saved if you were to refresh or leave the web page.  After a note is saved, you can open the note with its details by clicking on the note itself.  When you no longer need a note, you can delete it by clicking on the trash can icon to the right of the note.
